# Pattern Recognition in a Matrix — A Motion Prediction System

This project explores a real-time motion prediction system using matrix-based representations, multiverse forecasting, and lightweight neural fusion. It processes **pre-recorded video frames** to predict future object positions and visualize the trajectories using multiple motion models.

Rather than relying on deep learning architectures, this project takes a minimal yet effective approach—favoring interpretability, speed, and real-time adaptability.

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Motion Detection:** Frame differencing and contour extraction to isolate moving regions.
- **Multiverse Prediction:** Five parallel predictors ("universes") simulate different motion assumptions using affine transformations.
- **Neural Fusion:** A compact `12 → 8 → 2` neural network fuses predictions from the five universes into a consensus.
- **Real-Time Control Panel:** Adjust parameters like “Frames Ahead” and “Learning Rate” live via OpenCV UI.
- **Visualization:** Each predictor and the final neural consensus is rendered in real-time in six distinct OpenCV windows.
